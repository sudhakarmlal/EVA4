#### 1. Scenary or BackGround Images:

We have taken Home Images as background.Below is the gallery for the Home Images.A sample from the 100 backgrounds taken are shown below

#### 2. ForeGround Images:

Foreground images are also download.Below is the gallery for the same.A sample taken from the 100 foreground images are shown below

#### 3. Masked Images:

The Masked Images are generated for all the corresponding foreground images.A sample is taken for the 100 mask images  and are shown in the gallery below

#### 4. ForeGround-BackGround Images:

A total of 400K ForeGround-BackGround Images are generated by Overlaying foreground over background.Foreground is overlayed over background at twenty different positions.And also corresponding flip images for the foreground are generated for these twenty different positions.Algother since for one foreground there are  40 images on a specific background.A total of  40*100*100 =400K ForeGround-BackGround Images are generated.

A sample of  foreground-background images are shown in the Gallery below:

#### 5. ForeGround-BackGround Masked Images:
Similiar to the way the ForeGround-BackGround Images are generated by Overlaying Foreground over BackGround,The mask images are overlayed over the background.Since 20 different positions the Mask Images are overlayed and the corresponding  20 flipped images are also overlayed. So a total of 40*100*100(100 BackGround,100 ForeGround Images) i.e 400K masked images are generated.

A sample of  foreground-background masked images are shown in the gallery below:

#### 6. Depth Model Output Images:

A total of  400K depth model images are generated as an output of the depth model.

The gallery for sample of these 400K images are found below:
